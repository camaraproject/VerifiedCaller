  description: |
    This API provides the ability to associate a calling party number with a human-readable string that is displayed to the callee on their device screen instead of the calling number.

    # Introduction

    Consumers of this API can associate calling party numbers with a human-readable string that is to be displayed to the callee on their device screen instead of the calling number. This allows the callee to recognize the caller even if the calling party number is not registered in the callee's device and increases the likelihood of the call being answered.

    Brand Registration API could be useful in scenarios such as:
    - Telesales
    - Customer Support
    - Outreach efforts of NGOs.
    - Calls placed by authorities or government institutions for official matters.

    # Relevant terms and definitions
    * **phoneNumber** and **phoneNumberAlternate**: A pair of E.164 numbers representing the caller. Depending on the caller's networks access setup , only phoneNumber or both phoneNumber & phoneNumberAlternate may be used to uniquely identify the caller. The values typically correspond to parameters used in telecom signalling protocols, e.g. PAI and FROM headers in SIP.
    * **displayName**: A human-readable string that is to be displayed to the callee on their device screen instead of the calling number.
    * **customerId** : A string to represent the owner of the displayName, e.g. a commercial brand or an institution.
    * **verifyCallerAction**: An instruction applied during actual call setup. Indicates the action to be taken by the service provider if the authenticity of the caller cannot be established using VerifiedCaller API capabilities.
    # API Functionality

    The API exposes the following endpoints/operations:

    - `/registrations` :
      - **POST** operation creates a new registration and returns a registration identifier
    - `/registrations/{registrationId}` :
      - **PUT** operation updates an existing registration identified by the registrationId in the brand registration service
      - **GET** operation reads an existing registration identified by the registrationId from the brand registration service
      - **DEL** operation deletes an existing registration identified by the registrationId from the brand registration service

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    # Additional CAMARA error responses

    The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive. Therefore the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error statuses as indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guide`.

    Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release associated to this API version for a complete list of error responses. The applicable Commonalities Release can be identified in the `API Readiness Checklist` document associated to this API version.

    As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible error response if it is explicitly documented in the API.
