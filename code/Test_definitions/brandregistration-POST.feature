# Input to be provided by the implementation to the tests
# References to OAS spec schemas refer to schemas specified in /code/API_definitions/brand-registration.yml
# Implementation indications:

# Testing assets:
# * An optional customer identifier "customerId1" to indicate the owner of the registration, typically for logically grouping & billing the registration operations.
# * An E.164 telephony number "phoneNumber1" that is owned by the customer "customerId1"
# * An optional E.164 telephony number "phoneNumberAlternate1" that is owned by the customer "customerId1"
# * A display name "displayName1" that is to be displayed to the callee in case of calls made by phoneNumber1 and optionally phoneNumberAlternate1
# * An E.164 country code "terminatingCountryCode1" that identifies the target country of potenital callees where the display name is to be shown.
# * An optional verify caller instruction "verifyCallerAction1" that can be included in the registration to determine the action if the calling party's authenticity cannot be established via the capabilities of the Verified Caller APIs.
